I know two blog posts is a lot within a week, but because "someone" figured out how to spring the daycare coop (see: hunger and sleep strikes) and get daddy to pick him up early from day care, he and I have been spending some serious time together.

First, Eli put on an outfit that is obviously 2 months too big for him, but it looked comfortable and was flannel lined, so I went with it. Sometimes, as a parent, you just have to make these judgement calls.

Then Poppa came to visit. We had a regular old grand adventure visiting the British Art Gallery and mommy, before we came home for a little rest and play time.

\[Playtime: Eli teaches Poppa the basics of driving.\]

Later (look it had been a big exciting day), daddy and Eli were operating without the adult supervision of mommy when Eli had the bright idea of popping our collars.

\[Sadly, this is legal.\]

After that it was official, if we'd stayed up any longer, who knows how loud we would have been singing the ABCs. TIME FOR BED.
