With her typical care, Candice has watched me silently hash and re-hash a number of arguments in my head.  Many of you have asked to be kept up to date on our local little celebrity, and I have been trying to come up with a way that 1. dosen't spam you, and 2. meets my notions of not betraying Eli's right to privacy, leaving as much choice about what he shares online about himself to him in the future.

Plus, objectively, I can say he is so damn cute, we don't need any wild-eyed baby snatchers zipping through these parts.

So, my plans went from password protected website (not that user friendly), to an iPhone app (not that friendly to you Android users, as well as my brother unit, who is not a slave to "fashion" and the world's last remaining BlackBerry user).  Finally, end at this website, which is a weird compromise where I feel like I am lying to myself.  So bookmark, save, write down the web address for all things Eli &amp; acquaintances.

With that out of the way, on with the show!  Eli is doing great, almost 7 lbs great.  Which his extra-proud grandmother immediately started rounding to 8 lbs.  
All this weight gain has earned Eli a very popular second version of his nickname.  While technically still "Mouse", Eli sometimes goes by what sounds like "moose", you see it is just "mouse" pronouced with a French accent, which to the untrained American ear, sounds like "moose".  Voila.

This is what an empty Moose looks like when explaining how low his tank is:

This is what a full Moose looks like (note disproportionally large belly region):

This is what a Moose who is getting de-gassed looks like (gas buildup is a common, naturally occuring, moose-type problem):

All this is to say, Eli has been getting bigger and stronger every day, watching him is amazing.  For comparison, just a few weeks ago, the moose looked like this:
