Spending too much time with daddy makes your hair fall out.  To be fair, this is something mommy has been trying to explain to daddy for a number of years.  But this is different.

As Moose has gotten better at voicing preferences and deciding what he likes, he has become a real holding connoisseur.  Consequently, putting Moose down will sometimes get you a look like this:

That is even sans the Big Chicky outfit.  

Surprisingly, while not recommended by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the trick to calming an unhappy moose is to just pick them back up.  In a matter of moments, the moose becomes quite content, as evidenced:

While the turn of phrase never caught on, "awake like a moose" is shorthand for being both a "night owl" and an "early bird."

Because Elijah has taken to being "awake like a moose" we've done a lot of sleeping on top of daddy.  Once on top of daddy, he loves to worm his way right in under my chin, and consequently directly into any stubble which is hanging around.

When you multiply all that stubble snuggling by 4 hours a night, some of your hair starts to disappear.  And when your hair starts to disappear, you have to go looking for it.

We're told by moose experts that enough hair searching will lead to crawling.
