Eli has proven himself an adept manager, but as many of you can guess, supervising mommy and especially daddy, is a full time job. 

On Saturday, when Eli informed me he is looking to hire an assistant manager, I played it cool. For quite some time I've been looking to get in to the management game, but in a four person / stuffed animal operation, upward movement can be a little elusive. Throughout the afternoon, I casually brought up prior experience, skills and situations which make me a strong candidate.

Not one to ever be under-estimated, Eli quickly caught on and laid out the deal. You see when it comes to the coffee shop, there is only one employee (between daddy, Eli, sock monkey and The Rat) who can reach the handle of the espresso machine, and who is legally able to drive for more supplies. Without bragging here, I am pretty much the equivalent of Shaquille O'Neal standing on another Shaquille O'Neal's shoulders at the coffee shop and, well, a regular superhero.

So, while I was feeling pretty good about not getting a promotion, Eli was doing some careful consideration. This evening he informed me that he narrowed the list to two final candidates.

The first is the baby we always see in the mirror.

Eli really likes this baby, because like Eli, he seems to have a sunny disposition, never dominates the conversation, and when Eli is tired knows to mind his own business.

The second candidate, Ubbi, has been a long time confidant of Eli's.

Eli likes Ubbi, because he has obvious product experience, having for quite some time been a spokesperson for a high end "odor free" stainless steel diaper repository device.

Though Eli feels he has two strong candidates, he wanted me to let you all know that he is still considering other candidates.
