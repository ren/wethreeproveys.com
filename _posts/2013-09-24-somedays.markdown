A lot has happened since our last update:

Eli is all about standing, stomping, walking, and some odd hurdy gurdy hip wiggling dance move he obviously learned from his dad.

Smiling is generally considered a pretty great activity.

Sometimes you just have to burst into talking.

Sleeping remains an afterthought.

When you accidentally forget how much you like to stand, books are pretty good.

Eli is cool with the iPhone, but remains suspicious of our camera.

We found a sweet new bath towel.

We've been going on some driving adventures.

"Sitting" is a game we play with daddy, so he thinks he has time to do something, like brush his teeth. The trick is once he is at a critical juncture, forcefully let him know that sitting time is OVER.

Daddy, why did you only shave half your face?

Toe inspections have become more common.

Sometimes, during a toe inspection, your big head can be hard to pull back up to ready position. The bottom half of you (being lighter than your head) gets pulled up in the air.
