Elijah is a pretty introspective fellow. This shouldn't surprise you, because, well, a regular full grown moose spends a lot of time in the forest. Also, moose have elaborate hats, which makes navigating social gatherings difficult.

We've been able to tell that for the past few weeks Eli has been thinking hard about talking.  Not your average Twitter user though, he has bided his time and fully formulating his opinions.

Lately though, Eli has started to really open up.

The best part is that if the conversation is good, he isn't discriminating, you'll get lots of smiles and talking if you look like mommy, but you'll also get a lot of smiles and talking if you happen to look like a couch, tree or particularly friendly stroller.
