Elijah's cousin Joseph (the youngest Joe of the 3 Joe Circus which dominates Eli's extended family) is big in to racing.  He is pretty liberal in what types of racing he'll engage in.  For instance, when we race in parking lots, that's called straight line racin'. We do a lot of racing around the perimeter of Some Object, eg. Grandma's House.  One time we did a Daddy Spankin' Race, where we tried to see who could propel his daddy furthest via a well-placed spank (note to readers: this is a great way to get a few cheap shots on your brother).

Last weekend Speedy Eli got in on the racing action. On the inside lane, in the Green Machine Bubba mobile, powered by batteries and an engine producing maybe 1/4 horsepower, was Joseph.  On the outside lane (no barrel starts), was Eli's Chariot with an engine rated at approximately 3/4 human power.

For fear of losing one of our three regular readers, I am not going to declare a victor here.  But that's no optical illusion.
