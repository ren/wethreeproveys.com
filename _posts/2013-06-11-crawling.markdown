Trust me, while swollen full of pride, it scares the crap out of me.

Before you say "Impossible!" or "Impossible!" (in French or English, whichever way you like your tea steeped, cheese sliced, or macaroons macarooned), I present to you the following evidence:

1. All good crawling is preceded by letting your parents sleep just long enough that they'll (1) remember to operate the camera and (2) not accidentally drop you.

2. Looking at your hands and deciding not to eat them.

3. Laying flat, with your All-Star pajamas on.

4. Legs up and in.  At this point "All-Star" should be your highest point.

5. Legs up and out!

6. "All-Star" up! Back to ready position!

Experts tell us that the hardest thing about crawling (and just general for a small moose) is head size.  So while we do get a straight line crawl here and there, for the most part we've just been rotating in a circle-ish fashion around our enormous brain-holding contraption.

I swear if he had gone full-term, he would have crawled out of the delivery room.
