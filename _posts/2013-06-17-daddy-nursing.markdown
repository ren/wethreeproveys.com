Elijah pretty much has Mommy nursing down cold.  Lately though, he has been expanding his horizons to Daddy nursing.

One of the more signifcant challenges is that the whole nursing GPS system gets thrown for a loop when trying to Daddy nurse.  Not one to be put off by minor details and basic human physiology, Eli has tried a number of interesting daddy nursing positions.

My personal favorite is when he sees my nose and figures, "close enough":

\[Close Enough\]

I am not going to lie, the whole thing is incredibly cute, especially when you see this coming at the side of your head:
