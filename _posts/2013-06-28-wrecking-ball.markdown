Elijah and Team Elijah went for the big two month check-up this week. It is worth mentioning that Elijah met with a substitute doctor this time, as that'll become important in the next sentance. 

In addition to administering some preposterous number of vaccines (I can remember atleast 7), the abbreviations of which sounded like a commercial for the alphabet, the nice doctor decided to show us some disparaging charts.

These charts explained that Eli is a lot smaller than a full-term two month old. As explained by the (substitute) doctor, there is the line for the first percentile and about a half inch below that line was a little dot, which depending on the chart, represented our little mouse's height or weight. Why it is important to look at such charts can boggle the mind, but look we did, nodding appropriately, when to our delight we came to a third chart, which indicated that Elijah's head size ranked him in the 5th percentile!

This was something of particular delight, because we often coo over this cute little head.  It has a propensity for lifting itself up, looking you in the eye, wobbling, and crashing into your cheek.  Now we know, we're dealing with is a first percentile neck try and manuever a 5th percentile head.  Or, as we've started calling it, "The Little Wrecking Ball".
