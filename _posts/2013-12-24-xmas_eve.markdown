Eli feels like he has a basic grasp of Santa and spatial relationships, but he had some serious concerns about the relationship between the size of our fireplace and; 1. Santa, 2. all the gifts he has to get in here.

\[Waiting for Santa.\]

Filled with excitement and a poor internal clock, Eli woke up at 4am, 4:30, and 5. When we heard him at 5:30 it was official, we were AWAKE!

To pass the time, Eli played with some of his toys.

\[I'm not tired Daddy. Just don't look at my eyes.\]

Then he played with all of his toys.

\[Still not tired Daddy, just pile on some more toys here.\]

But as these things go, by 7am, it was official, Eli was tired and Daddy was caffeinated. Our young hero went off to nap, while I quietly blog.

Merry Christmas.
