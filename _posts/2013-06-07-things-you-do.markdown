It has been an eventful week for Eli.  On Monday he got to FaceTime with Abe and Abe's support team.  Tuesday, because mommy had the excuse "we really need to do laundry", daddy found Eli dressed in a very yellow chicky outfit.

Wednesday was Eli's actual "Coulda Been Your Birthday Day," where mom and dad celebrated with cheeseburgers.  Thursday, not only did we get a rockin' new carpet, but we did some big time tummy time:

Thursday, Eli also did a little doctor visiting.  Where (what is not news to anyone who has tried to pick up the Moose recently) he weighed in at a solid 7lbs 13oz.  Grandma has probably already rounded this up to 10lbs (why mess with ounces?).

One parent convinced the other that it was time to break open the "your child must weight a minimum of 8 lbs to use this" gear, because really "when they say 8 lbs, they mean 7 lbs" and because "that's just the way the world works" and "everyone knows that."

So out came this fantastic self-rocking seat that Uncle Joe and Aunt Erin had gotten Eli.
