So Moose likes to go to preschool twice a week, for about 45 minutes total. The biggest benefits are; 1. Dad has the illusion of free time, and 2. Eli makes sure to get updated with the disease of the week.

So, around midnight we heard one stuffed up little moose sorting around. The rest of the night, some number of us divisible by 2 or 3 to a whole number, were wide awake. Finally, with everyone back to sleep, Moose woke up and between pouty sad snuffles, flashed a few huge super tired smiles to let me know not to worry, we'd still be able to play today.

\[Daddy, lets pretend to be wet glazed doughnut monsters today.\]

We then put on our baggy 6 month old jeans and sweet Durham shirt to impress Aunt Corinna who was coming to visit (the keen among you may remember her as the aunt who tried to tickle a 4 hour old Eli in the ICU). The Durham shirt lasted almost an hour, successfully making it through a big poppy diaper, but failing to beat the bottle with vitamins.

\[Daddy, are you trying to make me wear white after Labor Day?\]

Eli showed Corinna a rocking good time though, bringing her to The Grilled Cheese Truck (ham with raisin chutney was the special today). Then a big walking tour of New Haven (no pictures, because we didn't have her sign a photo release and we have it on good authority she might almost be a lawyer).
