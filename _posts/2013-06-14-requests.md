Inquiring minds (mainly those of a couple of Joes (cousin Joe and uncle Joe)) have requested an update as to how The Rat is doing.  As you remember, we last left The Rat [scaring all the bejesits](sometimesyougetunexpectedpresents/2013/05/10/rats.html "Forget to nap") out of the local residents of our household.

After The Rat's inaugural blog post, the individual (the head Joe, of the Three Joe Circus which dominates Eli's extended family) who had acquired the Rat reached out to set the record straight on a few things:

1. There was a cute mouse at the toy store, but it didn't have much personality.
2. The Rat was hiding on the top shelf in the corner, feeling misunderstood. 
3. The Rat says he's a good rat and that rats in general get a bad rap.

So armed with that knowledge, we decided to do a little hanging out with The Rat.  The Rat seems to be doing well.  He seems to have maintained "good color":

His tooth is still doing well, I was afraid to touch it, but it is very straight and white.

Given all this, we have not found him nosing through our trash and his excellent dental hygiene, we decided to let him help supervise during tummy time tonight:

Overall, it seemed to go well. Candice and I privately wondered if maybe rats do have multicolored limbs, but very few maintain the level of hygiene that our local rat does.  Perhaps?
