Events have conspired. First, Eli acquired a Bumbo chair. Second, he noticed there was a lack of management at the coffee cart. Being a people person, Eli felt that he was a natural fit for the job.

\[Eli lays out his vision for the future of the coffee cart.\]

Eli has noticed a number of opportunities for improvement, for example, while employees used to enjoy free drinks, he realized that one employee in particular (daddy) was drinking the lions share of the coffee. Now employees get drinks at a 20% discount, which means profits are up about 7000%.

Eli also made me aware of some sad and troubling personnel problems.

Apparently, a number of employees have voiced concern about The New Guy.

\[Eli and The New Guy, who in addition to not having discernible internal organs, has maintained a coloring which is concerning co-workers.\]

Eli gave my fist performance review, asking that when I show up for the 5am shift, that I try to arrive not dressed in pajamas, have my hair combed and teeth brushed. 

He has also asked me to make a small note that this blog does not represent the views of my employer, so, well, there you have it, this blog does not represent the views of my employer.
