If you say it right, it sort of rhymes, I promise.

It has been a great first week for Eli.  While normally stationed in France, as luck would have it, Eli's buddies Whit and Melodie were in Massachusetts.  So on Saturday it was to everyone's great delight when they made the trip down for lunch.

They came bearing some stylish French duds, as well as the French version of Mighty Mouse ("Le Mouse de Cheese Cloth"), who is now Eli's sidekick and all around best buddy:

Sunday afternoon, Uncle Joseph and Erin showed up wielding bags of groceries to meet Eli for the first time.  Heart-achingly, little Joseph waited in the car (no visitors under 12 for a few weeks).

Beware, the story takes an interesting twist here.

On Tuesday evening, Poppa Joe and MaryAnn came to meet the mighty mouse.  In addition to bringing their love, Poppa Joe had also gone in search of a small toy for Eli.  While unable procure a mouse at Fairfield's local toy store, blinded by love, Poppa Joe did find a this very interesting rat, aka "The Rat":

The Rat has made a formidable impression on all residents of our little abode, already starring in multiple nightmares, and twice scaring all the bejesits out of me as I stumbled around looking to warm a bottle in the middle of the night.  In his short time with us, he has also inspired a mantra reminding us to sleep:

"Forget to nap, you'll end up like The Rat".  

Like I said, if you say it right, it sort of rhymes.
